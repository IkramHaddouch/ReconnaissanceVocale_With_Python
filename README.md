# ReconnaissanceVocale_With_Python

This is an AI project (Speech recognition). In the folder below, 'projet_parole1', you can find all the training data (sounds) so that the program can later recognize the voice of the person speaking based on the training data. This folder also contains the Python program code, which already has 4 files (dtw.py, fonctionDtw.py, fonctions.py, main.py).
